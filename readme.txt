This is a portfolio website showcasing three of my recent coding projects. "About Me" contains a portion with a little bit about my background and who I am as a software developer. 

At the bottom of the page you will find three thumbnails with links to my deployed/ published sites. Subscription Tracker and OneStock have been deployed using the Ubuntu server sourced on AWS. Office Invaders was published for user interaction using the Unity game community site. Click on any of the black buttons to navigate to the respective projects.

I used Bootstrap v4.0.0 to create the responsive layout which is viewable on both desktop and mobile screens. Find free Bootstrap templates on this site: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/.
